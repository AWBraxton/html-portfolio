<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As an Industrial Engineer, I am trained to be analytical and to optimize complex systems. 
    While I have acquired valuable skills and a strong work ethic during my degree, I prefer that it does not define me. 
    I aspire each day to evolve and better myself through a variety of lenses, whether that be enhancing my skills, broadening my perspective, or nurturing personal relationships. 
    I find fulfilment in my pursuit of realizing my full potential, but sparking a commitment to excellence in others is the true magic.</p>

<p>In my current role, I have a variety of responsibilities, including project management, consulting with client IT professionals, and perhaps most importantly, designing complex systems to perform beyond the sum of their parts. 
    I understand that the harmony of these components working together, coupled with overall simplicity, often leads to the most significant outcomes. 
    I am thorough in my approach and take pride in my quality of work and discipline.</p>

<p>Going forward, Iâ€™m eager to apply my process-oriented mind with my enthusiasm in IT to explore the world of development operations and become a DevOps engineer</p>
